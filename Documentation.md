# Welcome to UDPT #
UDPT is a lightweight UDP based BitTorrent Tracker.
You can easily start it up by just running it. It will run on UDP port 6969.
You don't need the strongest machine to run it, it's being developed for low resource usage - so it will be able to handle heavy loads of traffic.

This is going to be the UDPT documentation & guide. (still in progress...)

## Ideas? Suggestions? ##
You don't need to be a developer to come up with Ideas, you can help even if you don't know how to program. You can Suggest us Ideas & report any bug you find, all this in the Issue Tracker.

## Demo ##
I am trying to keep a server running with the lastest version of this software as a demo. You can use this tracker freely. The server might not always be online. The trackers address is: **`udp://tracker.openilt.tk:6969`**
