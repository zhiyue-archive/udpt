## The UDPT Project ##
If you are comparing trackers and wondering which one to install, you may find [WhyUdpt](WhyUdpt.md) interesting.

"UDPT" is a UDP based Bit-Torrent Tracker.
It is aimed for running on servers with heavy loads.
UDPT is aimed to be lightweight on the server and easy to setup.
UDPT is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 License, so you are free to use it for non-commercial use.

You may want to check out the [Documentation](Documentation.md).

UDPT is written in C/C++. It is compatible both with Linux and with Windows (It is being developed on Linux). UDPT is designed to be as fast as possible so we aim at low resource usage (don't need allot of RAM nor CPU). All releases are checked with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) for memory leaks (nothing serious found).

Since UDPT is mainly developed for Servers, it doesn't have a front-end (at least not yet!). We have a simple HTTP API for Index sites that want to use this software for specific torrents.
