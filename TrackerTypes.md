# Types of Trackers #
There are different types of Trackers,
There are Open trackers, Private trackers and Dynamic trackers.

## Public Tracker ##
The public tracker is a tracker that requires all torrents to be registered in the system, otherwise the tracker will respond with an error saying the torrent isn't registered. Public trackers don't require it's users to register ahead of time. Users can freely use public trackers as long as the torrent using the tracker is registered on the tracker.

## Private Tracker ##
The private tracker is a tracker like the Public Tracker, except it requires it's users to signup ahead of time. The private trackers normally disable the torrents from using any other tracker but themselves.
Private trackers know who is downloading what.

## Dynamic Tracker ##
The Dynamic tracker is a tracker that doesn't need to know what is being downloaded, and who's downloading it. It just receives an info\_hash and returns peers. Any torrent can be tracked without prior registration.
