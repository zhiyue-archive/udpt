# Frequently Asked Questions #
I Decided to create this page for Questions that may come up when using UDPT. If you have any trouble, feel free to comment on this page.

  * **Why Isn't UDPT listening to the specified port?**
> > Well, It is common with most trackers to go to yourhost.com:6969 (or some other port...) and see a page that would respond "Bad info\_hash". UDPT is UDP based (like what it's name says) not TCP based (like what HTTP uses).
> > So please prefix the tracker's URL with "udp://", don't get mixed up and prefix anything else. If your client is accessing you tracker with the "udp://" prefix, and your tracker isn't working - Then contact me and i'll try to resolve the problem.
